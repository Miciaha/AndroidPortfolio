I've created this as a place to begin working on an application that will host all of my smaller Android projects. Upon the time of completion, I hope to have gained more experience with:
* Utilizing Material Design
* Writing Cleaner Java Code
* Proper API Implementation 
* The Full Developer's Cycle
* Creating Beautiful Mobile User Interfaces
